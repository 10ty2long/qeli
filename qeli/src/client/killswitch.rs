//! Firewall kill-switch (Linux / **`iptables` CLI only** — never `nft` or `ufw`,
//! to keep the whole project on a single firewall backend, same as `server/nat.rs`).
//!
//! While engaged, ALL egress is dropped except: loopback, traffic out the VPN tun
//! device, DHCP (physical-link renew), DNS (so a hostname server can be resolved —
//! see the trade-off below), and traffic to the VPN server's resolved IP(s). So
//! when the tunnel drops, nothing of substance leaks onto the physical interface
//! during the reconnect window — closing the classic "real IP exposed between
//! reconnects" hole.
//!
//! Implemented as a dedicated `QELI_KS_<tun>` chain in the `filter` table, jumped to from
//! the top of `OUTPUT`; the chain ends in a terminal `DROP`, so it has the effect of
//! a drop policy without touching the host's global `OUTPUT` policy. IPv4 goes
//! through `iptables`, IPv6 through `ip6tables` (the old nftables `inet` table covered
//! both families at once; iptables is per-family, so we program both).
//!
//! Because the modern `iptables-nft` wrapper can return success while silently
//! no-op'ing, we VERIFY every rule with `iptables -C` rather than trusting the exit
//! code (same lesson as `server/nat.rs`).
//!
//! DNS TRADE-OFF: port 53 is allowed so the client can resolve a *hostname* server
//! address (otherwise the very first connect — which re-resolves the name with the
//! drop policy active — would fail). It is allowed **only to the resolvers this host is
//! configured to use**, never to an arbitrary destination: a blanket `--dport 53` rule let
//! every application's queries egress in cleartext on the physical link for as long as the
//! tunnel was down, and to a server of the querier's choosing — the metadata leak this
//! module exists to prevent. Fails CLOSED: with no non-loopback resolver readable, no
//! port-53 rule is installed and reconnects run off the allow-listed server IPs. The
//! residual leak is an application querying those same resolvers; use an IP server address
//! to avoid even that. (Windows and macOS scope this identically.)
//!
//! FAIL-SAFE LIFECYCLE — this is the whole point, read carefully:
//!   * [`prepare_engage`] pins the calling network namespace; its returned mutation installs `QELI_KS_<tun>` + OUTPUT jump and is idempotent (it
//!     rebuilds existing rules under temporary DROP guards). It is installed ONCE,
//!     before the connect loop, and deliberately stays up across every reconnect.
//!   * [`disengage`] removes the chain and is called only on a CLEAN stop
//!     (user disconnect / SIGINT / SIGTERM / loop exit).
//!   * A crashed run (SIGKILL / panic / power loss) leaves the chain in place — the
//!     machine stays locked (no leak) until qeli runs again, whose prepared setup
//!     replaces it. A failed rebuild retains exact `qeli-ks-rebuild:<tun>` DROP guards
//!     until a successful retry or explicit clean stop. To unlock without reconnecting:
//!     use the exact per-TUN chain shown in the log, in its original network namespace.
//!     Remove its OUTPUT/FORWARD jumps before flushing/deleting that exact chain.
//!     Repeat for `ip6tables` when IPv6 was programmed; preserve unrelated chains.
//!
//! Only meaningful in full-tunnel mode (in split-tunnel the dropped "everything
//! else" is exactly the traffic that is supposed to go direct), so the caller
//! gates on that.
